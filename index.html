My name is ${name}, Roll No: ${rollNo}, Enrollment No: ${enrollmentNo}.

I am writing to highlight serious issues faced during my academic experience at JMI CDOE (Aug-Sep 2023 batch):

1. Offline Classes Not Conducted:
I opted for offline mode expecting proper counseling and face-to-face classes. However, even after 2 years and exams, not a single offline session was held, causing academic disadvantage.

2. Late and Incomplete Study Materials (SLM):
SLM was delivered very late, often just before exams. Some students did not receive full materials, creating confusion and impacting preparation.

3. Poor Communication and Academic Support:
No timely updates, unclear academic calendar, first year extended unnecessarily, second year rushed. Lack of response to queries has left students stressed and uncertain.

Demands to avoid these issues in final year:
• Conduct offline classes as promised.
• Provide SLM promptly upon admission/fee payment.
• Share official academic calendar and deadlines.
• Ensure support system for academic queries.

Thank you for your attention.
